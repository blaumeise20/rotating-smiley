# Rotating smiley

This is a smiley you can rotate with your mouse or finger.

## Try it out
To run this app, you have to install the dependencies first:
```sh
npm install
```
To start the app, run this:
```sh
npm start

It will start a server at `http://localhost:3050` (you can specify the port in the `PORT` env variable). Open the URL and enjoy!

## Story

You may ask, why I made this. At some point I came across a site with a puzzle. There was a grid of letters and a card with holes, which could be rotated like my smiley now. I just asked myself, how it works, but I didn't do any more research. Then, at some point, I visited my uncle. He is a math teacher at a highschool, so I asked him if he could help me with this. We sat down together, he told me the formulars and calculations, and I wrote it down in JavaScript. The original HTML file I made can be found in [original.html](original.html). The code you can find in [/src](src) is a more beautiful and commented version of my rotating smiley.

## Smiley image

The smiley in this app is from Apple's smiley collection. It is a screenshot of the "grinning" smiley, scaled up.
